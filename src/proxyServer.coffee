exports.ProxyServer = class ProxyServer
  # Class representing an HTTP proxy, instrumented with 
  # hooks to capture and modify the request and response
  # before they are forwarded. The constructor takes 
  # a class as an argument that is constructed for each
  # request and recieves the following callbacks:
  #
  #   getTarget(req)
  #     given the request object, return an Object
  #     with attributes {host, port, https} of the server
  #     to target
  #   onRequestWriteHead(method, path, headers)
  #     called when the request headers are available
  #   onRquestData(data)
  #     called when a chunk of request data is sent
  #   onRequestEnd()
  #     called when the client is finished sending
  #     the request
  #   onResponseWriteHead(statusCode, headers)
  #     called when the server has responded with
  #     headers
  #   onResponseWrite(data)
  #     called when the server sends a chunk of data
  #   onResponseEnd()
  #     called when the server ends the connection
